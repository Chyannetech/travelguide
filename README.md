## Analysis

I created this project as a testing ground for my understanding of the useState React Hook and the filter function. In a previous project called TravelMoire, one of my aspirations was to acquire the skills necessary to create this particular feature, with the intention of eventually integrating it back into the project.

## Code Issues and Solutions
I encountered an issue related to displaying the data. Initially the webpage showed all of the data instead of what was being filtered. I searched online and read through articles for solutions to help me understand different options for filtering and hiding the data when needed.
